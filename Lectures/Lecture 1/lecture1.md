## Goals
- Access and run code on the Argon cluster at Uiowa.
- Basic linux commands for navigating / running code on Argon.

## Argon Cluster

- University of Iowa's HPC system
- 

## Prerequisites for Access

- To access from windows, you will need a ssh client, such as PuTTy https://www.putty.org/
- Personally, I like MobaXterm, as it has both a SSH and SFTP client for file transfer for file transfers built in to the GUI https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/
- For Mac OS X, there is a ssh client built into the command-line, open 

### Cisco AnyConnect VPN
